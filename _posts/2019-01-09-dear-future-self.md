Hello Future Self,

This is a capsule from you in the past, cemented in text form. It provides a slightly more objective representation of yourself, but you have to realise that when you read this you will also be coloured by your current experience and thoughts.

At the moment you enjoy formalising and creating tangible products from your experiences. I'd imagine this is likely because you haven't figured yourself out, and in some sense you don't trust your own memories and judgement.

I hope that you realise that you'll never be able to truly experience what I am experiencing, and that's a good thing. The amount of experience and knowledge you've gained is a valuable, even if you don't realise it. At the moment you realise that there's a lot of experiences that you've learnt but can't remember why, and there's lots of lessons that you'd like to remember.

Why is it important to remember why you learned such experience you may ask? In order to communicate it to others, and more importantly as an aid to ensure that you're confident in your actions, and satisfied with your choices. Even now I find difficulty in expressing this importance in words, so I don't doubt that you may doubt yourself on this lesson one day. I simply hope this letter finds you well, and that it help.

From,  
Past Self
