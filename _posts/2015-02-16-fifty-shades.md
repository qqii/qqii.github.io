The above quote is from the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Shades_of_Grey) on Fifty Shades of Grey.

Last saturday was the premier of the movie adaptation for the first book in the Fifty Shades trilogy – Fifty Shades of Grey. I considered going to watch the movie but as I haven’t read the books, I felt that it would be wrong to do so.

What I find interesting is how much this book has impacted society. I remember a drawing program that had different colors to choose from. Each color came in different shades, with red for example labeled [“shades of red”](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=shades%20of%20red). Gray on the other hand was labeled “grey tones”.
The impact can be easily seen if you google [“shades of grey”](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=shades%20of%20grey) and comparing it to another color and by looking at the search for shades of grey in [google trends](http://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#q=shades%20of%20grey).

Is it the fact that Fifty Shades covers a very strange area for society? Or is it actually that terrible of a book? It seems to me that this book is being attacked from all sides – women against mistreatment, parents and even the bondage/bdsm community. This leads me to question, why is it well known enough for a movie to be made (and make nearly 10 million for that matter)?

This brings me back to the start, I had considered watching and reading a book that has been rated so poorly, a movie that was rated so poorly that normally I wouldn’t even consider researching. It is because I’m curious about what everyone is talking about? Or maybe because I want to judge it for myself? Either way, maybe this time I should just give it a miss.
