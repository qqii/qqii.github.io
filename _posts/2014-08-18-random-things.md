I often find myself spending a lot of time on the internet, doing semi-productive things such as learning about the new 1+1 phone, dogecoin and other such things. Most of the time when doing things like this, I argued to myself that I didn’t know when I would need such information. Then there are other times when I drift aimlessly attempting to find something interesting or important. It’s times like that when I realise how counter-productive I’ve been. So I have decided, instead to share these things so that somebody might benefit from it.

## [Flubit](https://flubit.com/)
I’m currently purchasing computer parts for my first computer build, when I came across this site. Flubit takes any Amazon product, and within 48 hours offers you a better price. There’s no obligation to purchase or pre-payment.

## [Mechanical Keyboards](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Mechanical_keyboard)
Although I knew about mechanical keyboards for a long time, I didn’t investigate them until today. It turns out there are many types of mechanical keyboards. A common type is [Cherry MX](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX). Cherry MX switches themselves come in a variety of types, common ones are MX Black, Brown, Blue and Red. Brown and Blue have tactile feedback while Red and Black are smooth. Unfortunately they are much more expensive than normal, but boy do they feel nice.

## [Samsung Galaxy Golden](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9230_galaxy_golden-5814.php)
A flip phone that is a smartphone! With two screens and running android 4.2, this is the calculator of my dreams! Even since I was young, I’ve always thought flip phones were cool. Then smartphones came out and it became the rush build the most minimalistic phone. Then I found this, the Samsung Galaxy Golden! Someone else in the world shares my thoughts! Then I checked the availability in the UK. Unfortunately this phone is not available in Europe or the US, because of many US patents.
