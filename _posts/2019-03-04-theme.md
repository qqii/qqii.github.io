Dear Future Self,

After being unhappy with the look of this site for a while, I have finally decided to learn Jekyll from scratch and create my own theme. Initially I followed [this step by step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) from the Jekyll docs to get a grasp of how Jekyll works.

Most of the [themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) that I found were not that appealing, and somewhat inspired by [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) I decided to make my own. A monospace font and 80 character width was chosen pretty arbitrary, at the [possible cost of legibility](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/48753/does-the-use-of-monospaced-fonts-negatively-affect-legibility-of-article-text). I suspect that you'll probably regret this decision, but by the time you change your mind I hope you've got a better sense of design. There's a few things that I'd like to highlight, is nothing but as a reminder that the decisions you've made were not without thought.

### Colour Scheme

```javascript
/**
 * Does a thing
 */
function helloWorld(param1, param2) {
  var something = 0;

  // Do something
  if (2.0 % 2 == something) {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  } else {
    return null;
  }

  // @TODO comment
}
```
